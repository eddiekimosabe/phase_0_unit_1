// This is a Solo Challenge. 

// There is a section below where you will write your code.
// Do not alter this object here.


var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
/* Pseudocode Section - write pseudocode for each challenge below.

1. Define a variable adam and use object literal notation to assign this variable 
   the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties.

2. Give adam a name property with the value "Adam".

3. Add a spouse property to terah and assign it the value of adam.

4. Change the value of the terah weight property to 125.

5. Remove the eyeColor property from terah.

6. Add a spouse property to adam and assign it the value of terah.

7. Add a children property to terah and and use object literal notation to assign 
   this variable the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties

8. Add a carson property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
  the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carson".

9. Add a carter property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
   the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carter".

10. Add a colton property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
    the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Colton".

11. Add a children property to adam and assign it the value of terah children.

// My strategy was the same as the previous exercise. I was going to go through each challenge step by step and try to gain
// a deeper understanding of javascript. I was having some real problems reading and translating the challenge assertions
// so that I can correctly write the correct java code. I don't understand why but it took me a longer amount of time than I expected
// to write such a simple line of code. There was a disconnect between the whole translating the pseudocode and writing the actual code.
// My biggest question was when I got to exercise 6. I didn't realize you could use dot notation and object literals in the same area 
// without messing up the code I had to figure that out from a fellow cohort member. Also that spouse within a spouse part was unnecessary and annoying. 
// I'm starting to get an inkling of a clue as to how I should write out my code, but it's still a challenge. I'm basically learning
// a new language all over again, and it's not an easy one. As much as I complain about this challenge I feel as though I 
// did alright. It didn't take too long, minus property within a property part, and some of the concepts for Javascript were clicking.
// I'm beginning to gain a better understanding of what objects, properties, and values are and I'm learning which notations to use when writing the code.
// I enjoyed learning new ways to use javascript so there wasn't anything I found too tedious aside from trying to figure the spouse within a spouse part.
